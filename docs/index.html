        <h1>A Fingerprinting Monitor For Everyone.</h1>

        <p>FPMON is a browser extension that shows you <b>where, when and which browser fingerprinting method is applied against you</b>.
        You can use it to test your favorite websites and check your own websites for 3rd-party fingerprinting scripts.
        It can also be used to <b>test anti-tracking tools</b>.
        </p>


        <h2>Long story short ...</h2>
        <p>
        Browser fingerprinting has started to gain heavy tracktion, and current anti-tracking tools do not work like expected. 
        This is the result of <a href="">our large scale study with FPMON</a> that was done in early 2020. Our key findings are:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Fingerprinting is present on many websites with sensitive contents 
            <br>(health insurance, finances, news media, NGOs, privacy tools, etc.);
            In fact, 20% of the <a href="https://www.alexa.com/topsites">10k most popular websites</a> apply fingerprinting.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fingerprinting is privacy-invasive (allow user identification in many cases) and subverts current regulations like <a href="https://gdpr.eu/">GDPR</a> and <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a>;
          </li>
          <li>
            Anti-tracking tools like <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop">Mozilla’s Enhanced Tracking Protection</a>, <a href="https://privacybadger.org/">EFF’s Privacy Badger</a>, 
            <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/app">DuckDuckGo’s Privacy Essentials</a> can not sufficiently protect users and convey a false sense of privacy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serveral large fingerprinting networks push this technology forward and collect vast amounts of user data from their clients websites. (As shwon by our novel fingerprinting signature analysis)
          </li>
        </ul>

        Hence, we decided to publish <b>FPMON</b> as a free browser extension to empower web users against this growing threat.
